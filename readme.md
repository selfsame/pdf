# predicate dispatching for clojure / clojurescript

```clj
[selfsame/pdfn "1.0.3"]
```

> _***a multimethod style macro for compiling core.match style conditionals from ordered methods with predicate:argument patterns***_

Many languages have dispatching based on both arity and argument type.  Predicate dispatching is a similar system where methods variants define unary predicate patterns for the arguments.  When the results of applying the predicates to the args are truthy the method is called.

```clj
(defpdfn open)

(pdfn open [subject ^:contents object] 
  (str "opening reveals" (:contents object)))

(pdfn open [subject object] 
  {object (and* :contents :locked)}
  (str "it's locked"))

(pdfn open [^:key subject object] 
  {object (and* :contents :locked)}
  (str "unlocking and opening reveals" (:contents object)))

(open {} {:locked true :contents [:boots]})
>"it's locked"

(open {:key true} {:locked true :contents [:boots]})
>"unlocking and opening reveals[:boots]"
```

Method declarations are ordered. The user must reason about the specificity of the methods, but gains the ability to declare methods that override parts of a system without having to know the specifics. The absence of a predicate check is a 'wildcard' (nil).

```clj
(defpdfn ^:inline foo)

(pdfn foo 
  ([^pos?  a        b ^map?   c] :fish)
  ([^pos?  a ^neg?  b ^empty? c] :snail)
  ([^neg?  a ^zero? b         c] :mouse)
  ([       a ^neg?  b ^map?   c] :bird)
  ([^neg?  a        b ^set?   c] :dog)
  ([^odd?  a ^pos?  b         c] :lion)
  ([^even? a ^neg?  b ^map?   c] :horse))

(foo 4 -1 [])
>:snail
```

**pdfn** uses an implementation of [Compiling Pattern Matching to good Decision Trees](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/luc-maranget/jun08.pdf), which is used/explained in depth by [core.match](https://github.com/clojure/core.match/wiki/Understanding-the-algorithm).  

The compiled conditional has a unique path of ```(p v)``` evaluations for every method.

```clj
(inspect foo)
>(fn ([a b c]
  (if (and (even? a) (neg? b) (map? c))
    :horse
    (if (and (odd? a) (pos? b))
      :lion
      (if (and (set? c) (neg? a))
        :dog
        (if (neg? b)
          (if (map? c)
            :bird
            (if (and (neg? a) (zero? b))
              :mouse
              (if (and (pos? a) (empty? c)) 
                :snail)))
          (if (and (neg? a) (zero? b))
            :mouse 
            (if (and (pos? a) (map? c)) 
              :fish))))))))
```


## Usage
```clj
;clj
(ns foo.core (:require [pdfn.core :refer :all]))

;cljs
(ns foo.core 
  (:require [pdfn.core :refer [and* or* not* is*] :refer-macros [defpdfn pdfn compile! inspect benchmark]]))
```


# Docs

## defpdfn 
```clj
(defpdfn ^{:inline false :stub-arity true} foo)
```
Declares a symbol that will be bound to a compiled dispatch fn.  Meta data can configure options.

## pdfn
```clj
(pdfn baz [a b] :body)

(pdfn baz 
  ([a] :x)
  ([a b c & ^empty? more] :z))
```

* The ```pdfn``` macro defines a method variant for an existing fn binding.  
* The order of definition matters - last defined is the first to be considered.  
* Multiple methods can be defined in one pdfn.
* Different arities are compiled separately and grouped into the main fn.


```clj
(pdfn ^:inline baz [^int? a b ^:kw c]
  {b #{nil 0 false}}
  :body)
```
The vector binding uses meta data to define predicates. You can use `&`, destructuring is not supported. 

  * Meta tags only support ```^symbol```, ```^:keyword```, and ```^{:map :literals}```.
  * _Note: ```^:keyword``` is notation for ```{:keyword true}``` but pdfn interperates ( ```{foo true}``` ) meta as ```foo``` in the vector binding._

An optional map of `{arg predicate}` can follow the vector binding, as long as it is not the last form. 

   * allows most forms for predicates (**excepting** `#()` `(fn [])`)
   * merges onto meta predicates.

by default, every `pdfn` emits compiled code.

## compile!
```clj
(compile! f)
```
Explicit build command for use with the `:defer-build` meta option (used when small code emission is desired)

## inspect
```clj
(inspect fizz)
(inspect fizz :methods)
```
pprints code or method map, assumes user has a `pprint` alias.

## benchmark
```clj
(benchmark 100000 (foobar 5 8))
;"Elapsed time: 13 msecs"
```
Convenience macro for `(time (dotimes [i n] code))` 

### and* or* not*
```clj
(and* map? (not* empty?) (or* :red :blue))
```
predicate composition fns.

### is*
```clj
((is* 5) 5)
;true
```
makes equiv predicate

## configuration

meta data on the defpdfn or pdfn symbol can configure the following:

* `:inline` when false (default) methods will be externally defined.  External methods are usefull for debugging exceptions, but inline is easier to read when inspecting and is a bit faster.
* `:stub-arity` (default false) when true the compiled fn will fill unused arities with blank variants. (not including [& more])
* `:defer-compile` (default false) when true requires user to explicitly `(compile! f)`, avoiding code generation for every pdfn method step.


## REPL workflow 

`pdfn` has a few caveats due to the ordered nature of it's parts. 

* **`defpdfn`** eval removes `pdfn` methods and built code

**`pdfn`** re-evaluation depends on the predicate identity
  * unchanged - original method entry updated in the dispatch map
  * changed - new method added to the end of the dispatch map
